# InvestigateBayes
My repository for investigating Bayesian statistics.

My current work is around simulating A/B tests from a former company. Revenue was very hard to manage and I wanted to see if Bayesian methods could do better.

The files are:
  1_  Distribution investigation
  2_  Bayesian analysis with hurdle/gamma priors and also normal priors
  3_  Evaluatiing the tests from 2_
